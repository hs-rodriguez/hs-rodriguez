# Hi, I'm Hern√°n Rodr√≠guez

I'm a Software Developer and Electronics Engineering student.
I began my journey with programming when I was 13, when I read about how I could change some code and modify one of my favourite videogames and that seemed amazing for me.
I've always been an autodidact and I'm constantly seeking to further improve my knowledge.
